## Covid Data Exploration Project

This project aims to explore, clean, and analyze COVID-19 data to gain insights into the virus's impact on different regions, demographics, and vaccination rates. The original dataset was in Excel format and contained information about:

* Death tolls: Number of deaths attributed to COVID-19
* New cases: Daily new cases of COVID-19
* Vaccination rates: Percentage of the population fully vaccinated
* Age rates: Distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths by age group

The dataset was obtained from a publicly available source on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUlwQUJBMWptTHItVU05NFZnaEtucV9fVEtEQXxBQ3Jtc0tuNzFDNVJadUNGM0xyUHQ0UEJzbFhfT2NLLWJjUjBrNTl0aEczLWRHaDNzMDZ3eC1UYkwxZG1GUURJb0pWeGJlOE5DejNCNGlSMGtqMWJteWc0UmQyeUJDbGg2VENkVE5LVGdkT1Q5ZVVYUm40TEVLVQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fourworldindata.org%2Fcovid-deaths&v=qfyynHBFOsM) and contains data from various countries and regions. The data is comprehensive and covers a significant period of the COVID-19 pandemic.
